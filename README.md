## About the game

> In the build, when eating people the snake does not grow. It works fine in the editor. I haven't yet found why.

I wanted to try new things on a new project, so why not a Snake, I never made one before.

This game is made in Unity, with models made by [Lugolas](https://github.com/Lugolas "Lugolas Github profile page") with [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/ "MagicaVoxel download page").

### Things to note

- Made models from scratch.
- Made some animations but did not implement.
- First time use of a parent object to synchronize others. (_to make the emissive textures and lights appear_)
- Dabbled with materials in the code to manipulate colors.
- The snake does not work with coordinates but moves _"dynamically"_.
